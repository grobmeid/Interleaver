# Interleaver
An interleaver is a tool use in cryptology to encrypt a plaintext into a table, and taking every other letter and storing it into a table. 

You will need a text file to be sent to your file path, I never put in a directory for it to search for, so please put it in whatever directory you want to use and search for it.
For me I just used the local directory of the IDE. 

Got the idea of a using a list from Mark Burrell
